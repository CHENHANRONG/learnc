The choice of smart pointer will depend on your use case and your requirements, with std::unique_ptr with move semantics for single ownership that can be used inside containers (using move semantics) and std::shared_ptr when ownership is shared.You should try to use the smart pointer that best fits the situation, choosing the correct pointer type provides other programmers with insight into your design.
