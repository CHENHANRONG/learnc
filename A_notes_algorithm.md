# Summary
- Algorithm: method for solving problem.
- Data structure: method to store information.
- basic programming model.
- data abstraction
  - abstract data types (ADTs) 
    - bag
    - queue
    - stack
- Performance is a central consideration in the study of algorithms.
  - scientific method: we develop hypotheses about performance, create mathematical models, and run experiments to test them, repeating the process as necessary.
- Analysis of algorithms
  - Choosing the best algorithm for a particular task can be a complicated process, involving sophisticated mathematical analysis.

# OOP (object-oriented programming)
- Objects are characterized by three essential properties: state, identity, and behavior.
