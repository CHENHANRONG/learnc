## ML
- cross validation
- noninformative priors
- controversy and debate associated with frequentist and Bayesian paradigm
- bootstrap ( determine frequentist error bars)
- frequentist estimator - maximum likelihood. 
- full Bayesian procedeure
- marginalize (sum or integrate)
- sampling methods
- Markov chain Monte Carlo
- Monte Carlo (computationally intensive and have mainly been used for small-scale problems)
- highly efficient deterministic approximation schemes
  - variational Bayes 
  - expectation propagation
- max likelihood approach **systematically underestimates the variance**, cause **bias** which related to the **over-fitting** problem.
