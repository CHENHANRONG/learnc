// shared_ptr fails to clean up the memory when there is a circular dependency in the application design. Either the application design must be refactored to avoid cyclic dependency, or we can make use of weak_ptr to resolve the cyclic dependency issue.
//Consider there are three classes: A, B, and C. Class A and B have an instance of C, while C has an instance of A and B. There is a design issue here. A depends on C and C depends on A too. Similarly, B depends on C and C depends on B as well.
