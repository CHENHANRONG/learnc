### 372. Delete Node in a Linked List
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.  
  
Example  
Linked list is 1->2->3->4, and given node 3, delete the node in place 1->2->4  
```Java
    /*
     * @param node: the node in the list should be deletedt
     * @return: nothing
     */
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        // write your code here
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
```
